# Objective
 - To build an automated data pipeline and interactive dashboard to:

 - Analyze historical housing price trends across Australian states.

 - Assess the impact of migration and population growth on housing markets.

 - Generate data-driven hypotheses and visual insights.

 - Apply machine learning forecasting to predict future housing prices and identify potential high-growth areas.

# Data Sources
```
| Dataset                                 | Source | Table ID              | Purpose                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) | ABS    | Tables 1â€“5            | Analyze historical price changes         |
| Median Price & Number of Transfers      | ABS    | Table 6               | Median property prices & market activity |
| Estimated Resident Population (ERP)     | ABS    | Table 4               | Population growth tracking               |
| Net Interstate Migration (NIM)          | ABS    | Table 4/supplementary | Migration trends affecting demand        |
```
# Hypothesis
 - We will test and visualize the following hypotheses:

 - Population Growth â†’ Price Increase: States with higher population growth rates will experience faster housing price increases.

 - Migration-Driven Demand: Net interstate migration is positively correlated with housing price changes.

 - Price-Market Volume Relationship: Higher property transfers (market activity) lead to accelerated price growth.

 - State Variations: Housing prices grow at different rates across states due to economic and demographic factors.

# Machine Learning Component
 - Model: Time Series Forecasting (Prophet or XGBoost Regressor).

 - Target: Predict housing price index for each state.

 - Features: Population growth rate, net migration, previous price trends, and number of transfers.

 - Outcome: Future price projections (e.g. next 12 months) and state-level ranking for potential growth.

# Deliverables
- Automated ETL Pipeline
    - Scrape and download ABS datasets.
    - Transform and merge into a single analysis-ready dataset.

- Streamlit Dashboard
    - Interactive visualizations:
        - Price trends by state
        - Population growth vs price
        - Migration vs price correlation
        - Transfers and market activity

    - Hypotheses explanation with data-driven insights.
    - ML price forecasting with state-level future predictions.
